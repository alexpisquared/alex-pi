To store text in a file on Azure using a web API application, you can follow these steps:

1. Create an **Azure Storage account** to store the file. You can create a new storage account in the Azure portal by selecting **Create a resource** > **Storage account**.

2. Create a **file share** in the storage account to store the file. You can create a new file share in the Azure portal by selecting your storage account > **File shares** > **+ File share**.

3. In your web API application, use the **Azure.Storage.Files.Shares** NuGet package to interact with the file share. You can use this package to upload, download, and delete files in the file share.

4. To upload text to the file share, you can use the `ShareFileClient.UploadTextAsync` method. This method takes a string as input and uploads it to the specified file in the file share.

Here's an example of how you can use this method to upload text to a file:

```csharp
using Azure.Storage.Files.Shares;

string connectionString = "<your-storage-account-connection-string>";
string shareName = "<your-file-share-name>";
string fileName = "<your-file-name>";
string text = "<your-text>";

ShareFileClient fileClient = new ShareFileClient(connectionString, shareName, fileName);
await fileClient.UploadTextAsync(text);
```

This code creates a `ShareFileClient` object that points to the specified file in the file share. It then uploads the specified text to the file using the `UploadTextAsync` method.
